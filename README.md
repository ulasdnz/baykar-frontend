# baykar-frontend Tasks

You can find both JavaScript and CSS tasks in this repo. Under the Frontend-JS-Task folder, as the name suggests, you can find the JavaScript Task(Quiz App) and under the Frontend-CSS-Task folder, you can find the CSS task. You can download both of them and try it in your local machine. I also deployed them and you can find the preview links below.
